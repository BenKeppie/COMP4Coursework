\section{Customer Requirements}

Below is a list of all my general and specific objectives that I set myself in the analysis section. In this section I will determine whether I have met all of these objectives and the reasoning behind it. The subsections with *NEW* in the title are objectives that I did not identify in my analysis section; however during the course of my implementation, I attempted to meet the objectives. 

\subsection{Aesthetically pleasing, easy to navigate GUI.} %Need feedback




\subsection{Videos organised and filtering capabilities.}

This objective has been partially met. The video links are organised in the tricks table in the order of TrickID; however there are no fitering capabilities implemented in the program at this stage. 



\subsection{Correct and accurate mapping to the skate parks/spots.}

This objective has not been met.



\subsection {Correct directions from current location to skate park/ spot on the map.}

This objective has not been met.



\subsection{Non-biased reviews.}

This objective has been met to an extent.



\subsection{Clear database with a list of tricks in.} %Need feedback

This objective has been met.


\subsection{ Easy to filter through tricks known.}

This objective has not been met. As discussed before filtering capabilities have not been implemented in this version of the program.



\subsection {Display status bar messages at appropriate times to inform the user of changes *NEW*}

This objective has been met.



\subsection {Allow for the user to contact the developer *NEW*}

This objective has been met.



\subsection {Ensure that the profile picture can be changed easily *NEW*} %Need feedback

This objective has been met.



\subsection {Ensure that the profile name can be edited easily *NEW*} %Need feedback

This objective has been met.




\subsection {Ensure that the profile email can be edited easily *NEW*} %Need feedback

This objective has been met.




\subsection {Ensure that videos can be filtered by categories. e.g easy, medium, hard tricks.}

This objective hasn't been met.




\subsection {Ensure that videos load correctly and are linked to the right video.}

This objective hasn't been met.




\subsection {Ensure that videos are displayed at the correct size/resolution that the monitor of the computer is.}

This objective hasn't been met.



\subsection {Ensure the database can add, edit and remove trick data (Name, description, image, completed status and tutorial link).}

This objective hasn't been met. However part of the objective has.

\subsection {Ensure that the database is displayed correctly inside the application at all resolutions.}

This objective has been met.

\subsection {Ensure that the tricks are marked by how hard they are by a three way scale of: Easy, Medium or Hard.}

This objective has been met.

\subsection {Ensure a checkbox is by the side of a trick to represent whether the user has completed that trick or not.}

This objective hasn't been met.

\subsection {Ensure there is a search bar for a specific trick name.}

This objective hasn't been met.

\subsection {Ensure there are filters for tricks e.g Switch trick filters.}

This objective hasn't been met.



\subsection {Ensure that the map is accurate to current roads.}

This objective has been met.

\subsection {Ensure location of the user is not revealed to anyone else.}

This objective has been met.

\subsection {Ensure that the current location marker is accurate.}

This objective hasn't been met.

\subsection {Ensure that when giving directions to skate parks from your current location that the mapping route is correct and on viable roads. }

This objective hasn't been met.

\subsection {Ensure that the program can mark skate park locations.}

This objective has been met.


\subsection {Ensure no biased reviews are posted to the app and that they're moderated before they are universally posted.}

This objective has been met.

\subsection {Ensure the program runs fast without lag when navigating between areas of the application.}  %Need Feedback.

This objective has been met.
