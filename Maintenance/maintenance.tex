\section{Environment}

\subsection{Software}

During the implementation of my program I used a variety of software items to help me create the program for my client. The software I used is detailed in the bullet points below.

\begin{itemize}
\item Python 3.4
\item IDLE (python GUI)
\item PyQt 4
\item SQLite3
\item smtplib
\item pdb
\item SQLite Inspector
\item Notepad ++ v6.6.7
\item Google Chrome
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Usage Explanation}

The table below gives details of why I decided to use the software I used. 

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|p{3.5cm}|p{8cm}|} \hline
\textbf{Software} & \textbf{Justification for Use} \\ \hline
Python 3.4 & Python is the programming language I am most confident with as I have been learning it through the past two years at college. Python is also the most supported program at my college. \\ \hline
IDLE (python GUI) & This programming editor comes with the free installation of Pyton, and is the only programming environment available at my college. \\ \hline
PyQt 4 & This software is an add on to the python programming language which allowed for me to create a graphical user interface for my program. \\ \hline
SQLite 3 & This software came along with the Python 3.4 library and I also had some previous experience of using it, therefore I used it to handle my SQL queries. \\ \hline
smtplib & This module came along with the Python 3.4 library and allowed me to send emails to me (the developer) about any bugs in the program. \\ \hline
pdb & This module came along with the python 3.4 library and was readily available to be imported \\ \hline
SQLite Inspector & This piece of software allowed me to look inside my database and test SQL queries. This was available for me to use at college and home as my teacher created it. \\ \hline
Notepad ++ v6.6.7 & This piece of software allowed me to test my JavaScript code and allowed me to debug any formatting errors as JavaScript isn't formatted nicely in IDLE. \\ \hline
Google Chrome & I am familiar with using this web browser and it also has plenty of compatibility with lots of programming languages therefore I used this to view my Javascript script. \\ \hline

\end{tabular}
\label{tab:Software Justification}
\end{center}


Another reason for using all the programs I have used is the fact that they are free to download from the internet, which therefore creates a free application for my client to use.

\subsection{Features Used}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|p{3.5cm}|p{8cm}|} \hline
\textbf{Software} & \textbf{Features Used} \\ \hline
Python 3.4 & I used python to run my program which allowed me to test the graphical user interface of my program. I also used the code libraries which came with the installation of Python to code my system.  \\ \hline
IDLE (python GUI) & I used IDLE to write out my code and save it as a python file. I took advantage of the colour coded syntax and also the code predictor. I also used IDLE to run the python file.\\ \hline
PyQt 4 & I used PyQT extensively, from using pre-programmed classes such as QVBoxLayout to rewriting some classes such as the QWebPage class. PyQT was used to create the graphical user interface of my program.\\ \hline
SQLite 3 & I used this piece of software to write SQL queries that would allow me to add,edit, delete and retrieve data from my database and ensure referential integrity was enforced. \\ \hline
smtplib & I used the email sending capabilities of this module. \\ \hline
pbd & I used this module as an interactive debugger to help debug my code \\ \hline
SQLite Inspector & I used SQLite inspector for two functions. First of all I used it to check that data had been added/edited/deleted properly. Secondly I used it to check that my SQL statements were correct. \\ \hline
Notepad ++ v6.6.7 & I used this piece of software to debug and write the Javascript for my google maps integration found in the 'skatepark' tab of my program. \\ \hline
Google Chrome & I used Google Chrome to check that my Javascript code functioned properly inside a web browser. I also took advantage of the 'developer' features of google chrome to debug my Javascript.\\ \hline

\end{tabular}
\label{tab:Software Features Used}
\end{center}

\section{System Overview}

\subsection{General User Interface}

On every part of my user interface a QMenuBar is at the top, allowing you to access functionality of any tab from anywhere in the program, for example if you are on the profile tab you can click on the 'support' part of the QMenuBar and click 'contact support' on the drop down options and the view of the program will change to the support tab and load the correct widgets to allow for the user to contact support. A QStatusBar is also available on every page which displays messages at appropriate times, informing the user about changes that have occurred.

\subsection{Profile Tab User Interface}

The profile tab consists of a QToolBar at the top of the tab labeled 'Change Picture' widget allowing you to change your profile picture which is displayed in a QGraphicsScene. Below the profile picture there are 2 QPushButtons labelled 'Edit' and 'Save'. To the right of this there are three QLineEdits showing the users first name, last name and email address, to the right of these QLineEdits is a Recently completed tricks list. Below the tabbed interface a QProgressBar which shows the percentage of completed tricks.

\subsection{Editing Profile Table Information}
Once the edit button is clicked the QLineEdits containing the first name, last name and email address of the user become available to edit. Once the QLineEdits have been changed you may click the 'save' button to save the changes.Once the 'Change Picture' button is pressed a QFileDialog appears allowing you to choose an image from your documents to set as your profile picture.



\subsection{Tricks Tab User Interface}

The tricks tab also contains the QProgressBar below the tabbed interface. There is also a QToolBar with an option to add a trick. Below the QToolBar a QTableView displays all of the items in the tricks table of the database. Once the 'Add Trick' button is pressed a side form appears on the left hand side with QLineEdits, QPushButtons and QComboBoxes which allow you to fill in information about a trick.

\subsection{Editing Trick Table Information}

Once the 'Add Trick' button has been pressed you can fill in information about a trick, once the 'save' button below the form has been pressed the trick will be saved to the database if all the fields are valid. If a field is invalid then the invalid fields will be highlighted red. To delete a trick you select the row you wish to delete and then press the delete key, a confirmation message will appear and you click the 'save' button to accept the delete. To edit a trick you have to run through the CLI menu and then run through the appropriate steps.



\subsection{Skateparks Tab User Interface}

The Skateparks tab interface is similar to that of the Tricks tab, but the table is replaced with a QWebView of the Google map.

\subsection{Editing Skatepark Table Information}

To add a skatepark you click on the Google Maps object, the program will then automatically fill in the latitude and longitude of the marker. Then you need to fill in the skatepark name and description. Then click save to save the skatepark to the database. To edit or delete a skatepark you have to run through the CLI menu and run through the appropriate steps



\subsection{Reviews Tab User Interface}

The Review user interface is similar to the tricks tab. But the table is replaced with information about reviews.

\subsection{Editing Review Table Information}

To edit the review table you have to run through the CLI menu and run thorugh the appropriate steps.



\subsection{Support Tab User Interface}

The support tab consists of a QLabel containing my details as the application developer and a series of QLineEdits allowing the user to enter information to send a bug. A 'submit' QPushButton is below this form.

\subsection{Reporting a Bug}

A series of QLineEdits must be filled in, in order to send a message about a bug in the program. This includes: Users name and email address, as well as the actual message saying what the bug is. 










\section{Code Structure}

My general code was structured around a graphical user interface where I have incorporated PyQt functions and object orientated programming concepts which I have developed over the past two years of learning python. A sample of coding structures are shown below.


\subsection{Main Window}

The full main window code can be found in subsection 4.11.1.

\pythonfile[firstline=29,lastline=101]{./Implementation/main_window.pyw}

My main window sets up the basis for my application. I have structured it to be a class which means that it can be used and edited easily with broken up methods. My code structure splits up every different function of the main window into each method which allows for easy debugging and the ability to individually operate certain functions. My class extends QMainWindow and calls the super class to get all of the functionality of the PyQt object 'QMainWindow'.


\subsection{Tabs}

The code for the tabbed interface of my program can be  found in subsection 4.11.1, line numbers 77-112. And subsection 4.11.2.

\pythonfile[firstline=5,lastline=12]{./Implementation/main_tab_widget.py}

I created my own custom QTabWidget which allowed me to easily debug the problems which I was having in the early stages of programming my program. I pass 'parent' into the class so that when the CustomQTabWidget is instantiated I could call attributes and methods from the main window to aid the debugging of my program.
\subsection{Menu Bar}

The code for my whole menu bar can be found in subsection 4.11.3.

My menu bar allowed for a shortcut to any functionality in the system from any page.

\subsection{Tool Bar}

My code for all the toolbars can be found in subsections: 4.11.6, 4.11.9, 4.11.13 and 4.11.16.

\pythonfile[firstline=8,lastline=22]{./Implementation/tricks_toolbar.py}

The code shown above is the code for my tricks toolbar. The structured approach I had to creating a toolbar was to first create an action, and then link that action to a connection which would carry out a particular function. In this case, clicking the 'add trick' action would display the 'add trick' stacked layout of the tricks tab. All my toolbar files took the same structured approach to allow for a universal, and easy to replicate piece of code.

\subsection{SQL Connections}

My code for all the SQL connections can be found in subsections: 4.11.7, 4.11.10, 4.11.14 and 4.11.17.

\pythonfile[firstline=31,lastline=35]{./Implementation/tricks_sql_connections.py}

The SQL method shown above is taken from the tricks SQL connection code. This code shows the structured process for preparing a query and passing the executed query back down to the widget, therefore allowing for the query results to be displayed in a QTableView.

\subsection{Validation}

My code for validation can be found in subsection 4.11.8, line numbers 102 - 169. And subsection 4.11.11, line numbers 50-87.

\pythonfile[firstline=125,lastline=135]{./Implementation/tricks_widget.py}

This validation method is taken from the tricks widget (subsection 4.11.8). This code shows the structured approach I took to validating each field. First I gathered the text to be validated from the appropriate widget and then compiled a regular expression to compare it to. If the text fit the regular expression the boolean value True was returned and the field was coloured green. If the text did not fit the regular expression the boolean value False was returned and the field was coloured red.


\subsection{Main}

My code for every main module can be found on every subsection of the Code Listing section, at the bottom of each pieces of code.

\pythonfile[firstline=122,lastline=136]{./Implementation/main_window.pyw}

This piece of code shows the main module for my main window.This is an example of the IF statement which is run at the start of almost every module. This allows the module to be run individually which is extremely useful for implementation and testing purposes. It is also used to launch the application once the main window file is run.









\section{Variable Listing}

My data dictionary can be found on Figure \ref{tab:Data Dictionary} on page \pageref{tab:Data Dictionary}. My other variables that I implemented in my program can be found in the table below.

\textbf{Unused Database Table Views}

The figures below show the tables that I will use in the future to implement a multi-user system. However, currently the program is a single user system and therefore they do not have any data inside the tables.

\section {Testing}

To view my full test plan look at Figure \ref{tab:Testing} on page \pageref{tab:Testing}

\subsection{Summary of Results}

My testing showed that my program was not a fully GUI operated program. It also identified key, minor issues with validation which I will fix then the next version in my program.

\subsection{Known Issues}

There are a few known issues with my system. These are outlined below.

\subsubsection{Flashing Tables on Start-Up}

When starting up my program, the QSqlTableView objects load individually before loading the whole program (trick and review table). This doesn't cause a problem with the functionality of the program; however the start-up time is increased. Through interactive debugging using the pdb debugger I managed to find that the problem occurs when the model is set; however I do not know how to resolve this issue. I have attempted to move around the order of setting layouts as the problem would appear to be a problem in the order of setting the layout. However, doing this did not resolve the issue.

\subsubsection{Validation}

The validation involved with all of the file paths is not present in the code and the validation involved with the QLineEdit's on the profile tab are also not present. These would be fixed by a simple validation method similar to that of the 'add trick' and 'add skatepark' validation lines.

\subsubsection{Incomplete GUI}

My GUI is incomplete for my program as the review tabs functionality is not present. This would be fixed by an extended period of time for working on my program.









\section{Code Explanations}

\subsection{Difficult Sections}

\subsubsection{Creating a Custom Webpage For Debugging}

\pythonfile[firstline=8,lastline=18]{./Implementation/skatepark_view_only.py}

As I was having issues with the javascript functioning correctly within the python webpage, I decided to override the QWebPage class in order to activate the Javascript console message method. From this I was able to print the error message along with the line number the error is on and the error messages source ID which helped me debug my Javascript code problem.

\subsubsection{Google Maps Javascript}
\pythonfile[firstline=100,lastline=206]{./Implementation/skatepark_view_only.py}

For my program, I used multiple programming languages. For example: Python, Javascript, HTML and SQL. In my program I created an interactive google maps object in Javascript. I had to activate my own API key (AIzaSyC5RcJ7vLSEYF32KqDusnuRcLJiHW8EbDg) to send requests to the Google maps server. My code above shows the HTML, Javascript hybrid I used to create the interactive google maps object. This code contains all of the functions involved in the processes that my map object can carry out. For example: adding markers, hiding markers and adding an info window to a marker.



\subsubsection{Running Javascript From Python}
\pythonfile[firstline=55,lastline=55]{./Implementation/skatepark_view_only.py}

To run specific Javascript functions within my python file I had to access the custom pages' main frame and then run an 'evaluateJavaScript' function which then analyses my Javascript code and runs the corresponding function.


\subsubsection{Mouse Press Event To Allow for Coordinates To Be Calculated}
\pythonfile[firstline=45,lastline=57]{./Implementation/skatepark_view_only.py}

My code above shows the python code for listening for a mouse click on the google maps object. If 'add skatepark' form on the side of the tab was open then the coordinates would be filled into the longitude and latitude QLineEdits. 



\subsubsection{Deleting Rows From QTableView}

Through setting the tricks result table selection behaviour to selecting rows (shown below) 
\pythonfile[firstline=28,lastline=28]{./Implementation/tricks_widget.py}
I was able to select the whole row and therefore gather all the information I needed to delete the row from the database.

\pythonfile[firstline=59,lastline=64]{./Implementation/tricks_widget.py}

The code above shows an overridden class that allowed me to monitor if the delete key had been pressed. If the delete key had been pressed the variable row would be assigned all of the relevant row information, and this is then passed into a QDialog method which allows the user to decide whether they wish to delete that row forever (QDialog code shown below).

\pythonfile[firstline=68,lastline=96]{./Implementation/tricks_widget.py}

Finally the code below shows the SQL query executed to delete the row. The results table automatically gets updated with any changes to the database.

\pythonfile[firstline=11,lastline=18]{./Implementation/tricks_sql_connections.py}




\subsubsection{Sending Emails}

\pythonfile[firstline=25,lastline=34]{./Implementation/support_widget.py}

The code above shows the python code I used to allow for an email to be sent to me with details about bugs in my program. First of all I set the MIMEText of the email to include the message that the user set, followed by their email address. I then set a preset subject of the email as 'Skateboard Progress Tracker Support' and then send the email from a specially make google email account, to my personal email. I then use Googles' SMTP protocols to automatically send the email from my google mail account to my personal email.


\subsection{Self-created Algorithms}

My program doesn't contain any complex, self-created algorithms.













\section{Settings}

No settings need to be changed on the client's computer to run my program. All of the neccesary modules required are supplied with python, PyQt and my public API key is used to run the google maps object.
