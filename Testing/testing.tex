        \hline
        \textbf{Test Series} & \textbf{Purpose of Test Series} & \textbf{Testing Strategy} & \textbf{Strategy Rationale}\\ \hline
1 & Test the flow of control between user interfaces & Top-down testing & I habe chosen top-down testing as the flow of user interfaces is hierarchical due to the fact there are multiple interfaces which stem from an original, main interface \\ \hline
2 & Validation of input data performed corrected & Bottom-up Testing & I have chosen bottom-up testing as I need to test the lower levels of data input to ensure the information has been entered into the database. Only then I will be able to test other areas that use that information from the database  \\ \hline
3 & Test information input is stored in the correct place & White box testing & I have chosen white box testing as I will have to look into the database after I have inputted the data using the program to see that the data has been entered in the correct place \\ \hline
4 & Test algorithms and SQL Queries to ensure the output is correct & Black box testing & I have chosen black box testing as I will see whether or not the algorithm/query has returned the correct values, without looking at the internal structure of the code \\ \hline
5 & Test that the system fulfils the specification & Acceptance testing & I have chosen acceptance testing as this test is conducted to determine if the specification is met \\ \hline
