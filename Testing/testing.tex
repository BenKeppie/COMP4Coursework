        \textbf{Test Series} & \textbf{Purpose of Test Series} & \textbf{Testing Strategy} & \textbf{Strategy Rationale}\\ \hline
1 & Test the flow of control between user interfaces & Top-down testing & I have chosen top-down testing as the flow of user interfaces is hierarchical due to the fact there are multiple interfaces which stem from an original, main interface \\ \hline
2 & Validation of input data performed corrected & Bottom-up Testing & I have chosen bottom-up testing as I need to test the lower levels of data input to ensure the information has been entered into the database. Only then I will be able to test other areas that use that information from the database  \\ \hline
3 & Test information input is stored in the correct place & White box testing & I have chosen white box testing as I will have to look into the database after I have inputted the data using the program to see that the data has been entered in the correct place \\ \hline
4 & Test algorithms and SQL Queries to ensure the output is correct & Black box testing & I have chosen black box testing as I will see whether or not the algorithm/query has returned the correct values, without looking at the internal structure of the code \\ \hline
5 & Test that the system fulfills the specification & Acceptance testing & I have chosen acceptance testing as this test is conducted to determine if the specification is met \\ \hline

The screen shot above shows that the values of the database for the skatepark correspond to the location of the marker on the google map image.

\textbf{Test 5.00 Evidence}

All of the previous annotated samples contribute to Test 5.00. There are elements of my program which work as intended e.g The name line edit did not contain the correct validation which lead to the failure of that test series  (Figure \ref{fig:Test 2.00} on page \pageref{fig:Test 2.00}). On the other hand most of my tests passed e.g saving tricks  (Figure \ref{fig:Test 3.03} on page \pageref{fig:Test 3.03}). This was also brought to my attention by my client as shown by an email conversation below.

\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{Approach to Testing} %MORE JUSTIFICATION

For each of my test series I used a different approach to testing. For my first test series I chose to use top-down testing as the flow of user interfaces was hierarchical. This was the best option as there are multiple interfaces which stem from the original interface. For my second test series I chose bottom-up testing as I needed to test the lower levels of data input to ensure the information had been entered into the database. Following this, it allows me to test other areas of my program which use the information from the database. For my third test series I chose to use white box testing as I for the individual tests I have to look inside the database after inputting information into the program, which then adds the data to the database. For my fourth test series I chose black box testing as I was checking to see if algorithms returned the correct value without looking at the internal structure of the code. Finally, for my fifth test series I chose acceptance testing as this is conducted to determine if the specification is met.


\subsection{Problems Encountered} %CROSS REFERENCE

Testing my program allowed me to identify areas of the system which did not work as intended. These tests are identified below, with an explanation. I will endeavour to fix all of the errors for the final release of my program which I will give to my client.

\textbf{Test 2.00 and Test 2.02 }

The line edits in the 'profile' tab which allow you to edit your first name, last name and email did not include any validation on them. This is a minor issue that could easily be fixed by a short validation method. 

\textbf{Test 2.01 and Test 2.05}

When uploading pictures for the program, the file type accepted was supposed to be limited to a .jpeg file; however the program accepted any file type. This is a minor problem, but can be annoying as file types that aren't .jpeg will not be displayed. For example, if a .txt file is uploaded for the profile picture, the profile picture will appear to be blank. This could easily be fixed by a short validation method and then a message being displayed on the status bar. 


\textbf{Test 5.00}

The build up of minor errors, along with the fact that the graphical user interface is not complete within the reviews tab, has lead to the failure of this test. For this test to pass the whole program would have to be completed at a usable graphical user interface level, along with every test series passing. This means I am not that far off passing this test as all that needs to be done is a few validation methods in certain input areas and the review table input form functionality.

\subsection{Strengths of Testing} %MAKE MORE STATEMENTS AND BACK UP WITH EVIDENCE.

I feel that my testing methods were particularly strong. This was partnered with the large amount of individual tests in each test series to show which parts of my program worked, and which parts didn't. The use of multiple different testing types allowed for my system to be tested in many different aspects which then gave a rigorous analysis of the functionality of my program. My testing allowed me to see if the functions made the correct changes to the database and user interface.

\subsection{Weaknesses of Testing}

The weakness of my testing is the fact that not every single aspect of my program was identified, therefore there could be some areas of my program which have errors in, of which I do not know about. My testing also doesn't look at the internal structure of the code. This means that there could be parts of my code which are inefficient and therefore could be coded in a much more efficient way which would lead to less processing power needing to be used as well as a faster program.

\subsection{Reliability of Application} %EVIDENCE?

The reliability of my program is questionable. It carries out most of the initial functions that I set for it to do; however some key features are missing and my testing has highlighted those areas. With a few minor tweaks, these issues would be rectified. The two main problems with the reliability of my program lie within the validation of some fields and the mixed program usage (graphical user interface and command line interface). As I didn't have time to complete the command line interface, some of the functionality (the review tab) is only available to use in a command line interface. This is not a problem within the functionality, but for my client, this form of information editing is not acceptable. None of the image parts of my program validate the file type which is a key contributing factor to the decreases reliability of my program. Looking back on my program I should have changed some of the entry field to fixed combo boxes as the some of the information that can be entered into the database could be inaccurate, and therefore my program is only as reliable if the data input is accurate.

\subsection{Robustness of Application} %EVIDENCE 

Even though my application failed a few of its test series, I would still deem my program robust. Regardless of whether parts of the program didn't work, at no time did this cause the program to crash, lose any data or start an infinite loop which would leave the program unable to use. With some of my input fields, even if data is not designed to go into an input field, an error message is displayed and the program continues as normal. This is a good quality of my program as the support section will allow for users to report errors that happen as the program doesn't crash due to the errors. This will then allow for me to identify the error, fix it and send out a new release of the program.
